According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness), "mindfulness is the intentional, accepting and non-judgmental focus of one's attention on the emotions, thoughts and sensations occurring in the present moment, which can be trained by meditational practices... Mindfulness practice is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and in the prevention of relapse in depression and drug addiction. It has gained worldwide popularity as a distinctive method to handle emotions."

Mindfulness can be a powerful tool in anyone's personal growth by alleviating maladaptive thought and emotional patterns, decreasing judgment of thoughts and emotions, and increasing focus on the present moment.

Mindfulness is often taught in meditative or therapeutic settings, and as students gain mastery they may practice mindfulness on their own, during their day-to-day lives.

Stay Mindful aims to make mindfulness teaching more accessible. Journaling is an effective method of forcing oneself to explicitly reflect on thoughts, emotions, urges and judgments. The core feature of Stay Mindful is its journaling functionality.

On the journal entry page, Stay Mindful also prompts the student to enter observations, such as emotions and urges, and rate their intensity. This provides a way to factually observe one's internal experience, and notice any judgments that appear when doing so.

Stay Mindful allows users to set goals that they would like to be reminded of when entering a new journal entry. These can be things like "focus on your breath" and "try not to judge your urges." These will be displayed as prompts on the journal-entry page. Users can rate their success on a given day with these goals, and track their success over time.

Journal entries can be shared with others, such as friends and family members that are part of one's support system.
